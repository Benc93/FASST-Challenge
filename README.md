##End of Week One challenge

###Challenge Details

The Challenge was to design a simple underground train network with the following capabilities:  
1. The system must contain trains  
2. Trains can travel between stations   
3. Inside the stations, passengers must be able to alight and board the train  
4. A passenger must 'touch in' and 'touch out' of their station  
5. Each coach has a maximum passenger capacity  
6. Each train has a number of coaches (not explicitly fixed)  
7. As a bonus - include a payments system where only passengers with more than Â£2 can 'touch in'
